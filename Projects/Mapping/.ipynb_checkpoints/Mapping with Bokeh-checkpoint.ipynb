However when I got into the mapping participation project, it beame obvious that the two projects simply didn't sit well together.

    "[Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.\n",

    "Patches are objects within bokeh that can can be added to a plot, they are made up of a list of lists then contain the x and y values, colours, transparencies etc. As longitude and latuitudes are really just x and y values, you can feed bokeh a series of x and y co-ordinates as lists from a kml file for example and it will draw a county, region or country.

In order to get from the population figures to an alpha value, we get the maximum state population and divide each state's population by that figure.
