## about the project

The project is split into two parts, [Mapping with Bokeh](https://github.com/davidcoxon/Python/blob/master/Projects/Mapping/Mapping%20with%20Bokeh.ipynb) and [Mapping Participation](https://github.com/davidcoxon/Python/blob/master/Projects/Mapping/Mapping%20Participants.ipynb).

**Mapping with Bokeh**, is based one of the practice exercises on the [‘Interactive Visualisation with Bokeh’](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/interactive-data-visualization-with-bokeh) course by Bryan Van de Ven on DataCamp. In the exercise you’re introduced to ‘patches’ and map a couple of US states. In this project we ‘patch’ the remaining state and use population data from a separate data source to visualise state size against population across the United States.

**Mapping Participation**, this project is based on the process  that I use to report on participation of learning activity in my role as Head of IT at BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art.

It includes FreeMapTools, Googlemaps and Folium and uses dictionaries to split reporting into participation from inside and outside of Gateshead.
