# Mapping

## about the project

Several of my recent projects have included working with maps or mapping data and while i canâ€™t share them because they include personal data I hope share some of the code and the tools that I used here. in the entire dataset and subsetting to those
dates.

The project will include information on Google Maps, using longitude and latitude to calculate distance, Bokeh plots and the folium library.
