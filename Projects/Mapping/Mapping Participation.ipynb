While this is really useful information it doesn't give any feeling for where these area in relationship to other events or activities or how close to the Gateshead Council boundary. Seeing this on a map makes it far more transparent. \n",

    "The Folium Library is build on top of a javaScript library called Leaflet and by default circles in Leaflet take a radium in Metres which doesn't change as you zoom in and out and while there is talk on updating Folium to follow the same rules, the current default in for the size of the circles to change with zoom. The Size of the circles is therefore relative to the average travel distance on this plot rather than absolute. The learning team also feel that it would be more meaning ful if scale were related to number of participant rather than travel time."

    "At the start of this exercise I mentioned that this project was based on real every 3 montha with colleagues from our Learning and Engagement team. In truth up until now the mapping element of that work i'd normally done with Google Maps, the the bulk of project usually being producng the statistical analysis on where participant come from and in particular how well represresented participant from Gateshead are in those numbers.\n",

I found Folium relatively easy to pick up, within a few lines of code you could rapidly build up map data that give you really useful insites into were individual participants were from, where clusters of participants were to be found and whether there were any pockets of the local communinity that we arn't currently engaging with, all of which will help shape the future core gallery learning programme and off site activity. \n",
