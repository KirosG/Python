## about this project

‘Noughts and Crosses’ is a classic kids game. There isn’t much too it, and the rules are really simple, making it the idea candidate for learning to code.

I first came across the basic code for this project on a ‘Code club’ activity sheet, but it was written for Python 2.7 and when you got 3 in a row it simply wouldn’t let you place another marker, rather than telling you someone had won.

For this project I’ve tweaked the original code to make it work with Python 3.6 and i’ve added additional code to tell you who’s won or if it’s a draw.

## future developments

When I’ve learnt a bit more about machine learning, I plan to come back to this project and make a version where you play the computer rather than another player.
