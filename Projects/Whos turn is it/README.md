# Who’s Turn is it to Make the Coffee.

## A first Python Project

This project was my first python project. I'd just started the DataCamp Data Science track and was learning to write functions. At the time I created this code I was on holiday in the English Lake District with my extended family. There are 7 of us, 5 adults and 2 children, so my first function simply help us decide who's turn it was to makes the tea and coffee next.

The project deals with creating a reusable function and a random  number generator enabling the function to decide who’s turn in is to make the coffee. The code is based on the Data Science Toolbox (Part 1) tutorials.
