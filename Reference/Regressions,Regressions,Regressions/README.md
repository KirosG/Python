## about this repository

Linear Regressions are one of building blocks of data science, and as such there are a number of of different approaches to producing Linear Regressions and a number of different ways we can can describe or talk about. 

Within this project we will have a look at several different approaches to generating a linear regression, and weâ€™ll explore the ways we can use, measure and describe the resulting regressions.

We'll use the same dataset for each of the regressions we produce and see how the different techniques compare.

## other repositories

I also have a [Projects Repository.](https://github.com/davidcoxon/Python/tree/master/Projects).This is meant as a place where I can experiment with the different techniques that I am learning, and get feedback from the Python community on how I can improve upon my coding.
